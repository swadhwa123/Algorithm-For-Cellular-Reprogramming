#figure out which stem cell data to use and read in that file, normalize the same way that the geo data is normalized if 
#they are not already normalized
#store information for theses stem cells in an array
#Convert GEO normalized data from .txt to .csv
#read in the file and store in array 
#make a data frame with the time series data 

#Use information from Hi-C or PCA to reduce dimensionality

#Create state-dependent transition matrix, which gives us the deviation from the avg of each state as the cell evolves

#Read in the B-matrix

#Transcription factor stuff?


#test
